Description: 
  Tempo is a social scheduling app that contains calender, to do list, schedular for classes for you and also for your friends. In Tempo, every user has a profile and friend list. It gives you an oppurtunity to create common schedule with your friends so everybody can spesify his / her free time or the times he / she is not available. (???) In addition, you can send a notification with your location that allows others to know you are available and looking for someone to hangout.
